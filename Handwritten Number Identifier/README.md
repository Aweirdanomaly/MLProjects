#Project Description
This is just the default MNIST number detecting project most people do when starting with ML. 
I did it on my winter break Freshman year just to get acquainted with the subject.
It's pretty self-explanatory, but I detailed what I did on the actual project file above.

(You can open it on any Notebook app, but I personally used it on Google Collab. Just press Ctrl+F9 to run everything at once)
